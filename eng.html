		<h1>The Laburnum Top by Ted Hughes</h1>
		<p>The poem "The Laburnum Top" by Ted Hughes uses the image of a laburnum tree and a goldfinch to explore themes of nature, family, and the passage of time. The poem begins with a description of the laburnum tree, which is silent and still, symbolizing a sense of peace and quietude. However, this stillness is disrupted by the sudden arrival of a goldfinch, which brings with it a flurry of activity and energy. The goldfinch is described as a "machine" that "starts up" and "trembles and thrills" the entire tree. This suggests that the goldfinch is a force of life and vitality, and that its presence brings the laburnum tree to life.</p>
		<p>The poem also touches on the idea of family, with the goldfinch's "engine" being described as "the engine of her family". This line suggests that the goldfinch is not just a solitary creature, but is connected to a larger community or family.</p>
		<p>The poem ends with the goldfinch "launching away" and the laburnum tree "subsided to empty", suggesting that the cycle of life continues, even as individual beings come and go. The poem can be interpreted as a meditation on the beauty and transience of nature, and on the interconnectedness of all living things.</p>
