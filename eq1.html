    <h2>Equation 1:</h2>
    <p class="equation">(1 + i)<sup>-5</sup> &times; (1 + 1/i)<sup>5</sup> = 32</p>
    <p class="explanation">
        This equation involves raising the complex numbers to the power of 5 and multiplying the results. The first term is (1 + i) raised to the power of -5. 
        The second term is (1 + 1/i) raised to the power of 5. Simplifying 1/i gives -i, which transforms the second term to (1 - i). 
        Solving this gives us the final result equal to 32.
    </p>

    <h2>Equation 2:</h2>
    <p class="equation">(1 - i)<sup>n</sup> &times; (1 - 1/i)<sup>n</sup> = 2<sup>n</sup></p>
    <p class="explanation">
        In this equation, the base (1 - i) and (1 - 1/i) are both raised to the power of <em>n</em>. As in the previous case, 1/i is equivalent to -i, simplifying the second term to (1 + i). 
        The multiplication of both expressions results in 2<sup>n</sup>.
    </p>

    <h2>Equation 3:</h2>
    <p class="equation">(1 - 1/i)<sup>4</sup> &times; (1 - 1/i)<sup>4</sup> = -8</p>
    <p class="explanation">
        Here, both terms are (1 - 1/i), which simplifies to (1 + i). Each of these terms is raised to the power of 4, and their product results in -8. 
        The negative value comes from the powers of complex numbers, particularly when dealing with imaginary units.

    <h3>Key Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In these equations, <strong>i</strong> represents the imaginary unit, where <em>i</em><sup>2</sup> = -1.</li>
        <li>The simplification of terms involving 1/i results in the transformation of the terms into expressions with <strong>i</strong> or <strong>-i</strong>.</li>
        <li>The powers of complex numbers follow the rules of exponents and can be simplified using De Moivre's Theorem.</li>
    </ul>
